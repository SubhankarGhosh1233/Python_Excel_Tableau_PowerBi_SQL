# Hotel Revenue Analysis With Python and Power BI
Revenue management is more crucial than ever to run a successful and profitable hotel. With all the information that's now readily accessible and there are different ways to track and analyze it, your business has a wealth of new opportunities. Successful hoteliers continuously learn and improve their methods to stay one step ahead of their competition. Revenue management strategies are used by only a small percentage of independent hoteliers, limiting their revenue-generating potential.
