# City Bike Project Management  Analytics

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.


# REQUIREMENTS
Our task in this Project is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report. I may work with a timespan of my choosing. Optionally, I may merge multiple datasets from different periods. The following are some questions I may wish to tackle, especially if I am working with merged datasets. Do not limit yourself to these questions; they are suggestions for a starting point. Be creative!
### Task needs to be achieved:
1. Acquire the data, dump the data into some of the databases (SQL, MongoDB, Casandra local or cloud version)
2. Connect with the business user and try to get the understanding of the data attribute 
3. Connect with the business user and try to get the understanding about the KPI (Key performance indicator)
A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key business objectives
4. Connect with the business user with raw visualization and gather user experience and expectations feedback based on ease of use 
5. Decide total number of dashboards based on user hierarchy and organization 
6. Start building production-based dashboard 
7. Below are the KPI which need to be captured 



# Task
1. How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
2. By what percentage has total ridership grown?
3. How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
4. What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)
5. What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)
6. What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)
6. What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)
7. What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
8. How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?
9. How does the average trip duration change by age?
10. What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?
